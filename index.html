        <h1 class = "footer">Inspired by the website howmanyfuckingswipesshouldihave.com, 
            which calculates the number of swipes a UCLA student needs to finish before the end of the quarter, 
            we created 'how many slugpoints should i have', slugpoints.tech, to address a similar issue at UCSC. 
            During the final week of last quarter, we saw students frantically trying to use up their 
            non-refundable points before the quarter ended. Dining hall swipes were being passed around like hotcakes, 
            campus markets and cafes sold out before they even opened, and cases of Yerba Mate's were seen around campus at record numbers. 
            Students were scrambling to get rid of hundreds of dollars worth of meal swipes. We created this website to help save UCSC students' 
            time and money, while also providing comedic comments.</h1>
